# Gnosis Safe wallet creator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and intentionally downgraded to version 17. It seems that `@gnosis.pm/safe-ethers-lib` doesnt work correctly with the latest version 18.

### Clone the project

`git clone https://github.com/kzhama/mural-part-2.git`

### Install all dependencies

`npm i`

### Start the project

`npm start`
